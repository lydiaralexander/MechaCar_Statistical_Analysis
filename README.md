## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Question 1: Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

  Answer 1: The vehicle_length and the ground clearance.
  
Question 2: Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? why or why not?

  Answer 2: The slope is not considered to be zero.  The P-Value is 5.35e-11, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%.  Therefore, there is sufficient               evidence that the slope of our linear model is not zero.
   
Question 3: Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or Why not?

  Answer 3: Yes, it does.  In this study, r-squared = 0.7149 indicating that over 70% of the variability of our dependent variable is explained using this linear model.
